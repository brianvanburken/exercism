# Triangle

Write a program that can tell you if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

The program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

Tests are provided, delete one `skip` at a time.

## Hint

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the
length of the third side, a principle known as the _triangle
inequality_.

Refer to the [Exercism help page](http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-coffeescript.html) for getting started with CoffeeScript.

In order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called hello_world.spec.coffee, you can run the following command:
    jasmine-node --coffee hello_world.spec.coffee
