# Robot Name

Write a program that manages robot factory settings.

When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.

The first time you boot them up, a random name is generated, such as
RX837 or BC811.

Every once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings,
which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it will
respond with a new name.

Random names means a risk of collisions. In some exercism language
tracks there are tests to ensure that the same name is never used twice.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

http://help.exercism.io/getting-started-with-javascript.html

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ jasmine-node .
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
